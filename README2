This is project presents an analysis of publicly available data on Natural Disaster Declarations in the United States.
The dataset, United States Natural Disaster Clarations, is sourced from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and accessed via Kaggle.

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/headsortails/us-natural-disaster-declarations 

The dataset includes information on disaster incidents types, geographic locations, FEMA declaratoin numbers, and declaratoins dates amoung other tributes.
It provides a historical record of major disaster declarations accross U.S States and territories spanning more than seven decades. 

Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using Microsfot Excel and Python with Jupyter Notebook. These steps included removing duplicate records, refining
incident categories, and restructuring data for accurate state-level and temporal analysis. Detailed descriptions of the data cleaning process, libraries used
and analytical methods can be found in the accompanying written report, particualry in "Data Analysis" section. 

The project focuses on comparing disaster patterns across U.S. states examining dominant disaster types, temporal trends and overall disaster volume. Visualizations 
include frequency charts, scatter plots and geospatial maps to highlight regional and historical patterns. 

This repository is intended to complement the written report and serves primarily as a visual and exploratory analysis of the dataset
